## DevOps EYE
This project checks important service providers' status page like gcloud  to see if there's no current incident and sends a notification to slack channel if there's a new one

## How to use 
Set slack webhook URL in a `.env` file right beside the `main.py` then: 
In the directory of application run `docker compose up`
